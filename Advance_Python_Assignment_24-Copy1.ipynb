    "Question:-Q2. What are some of a module's characteristics? (Name at least one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-A module is a part of a program. Programs are composed of one or more independently developed modules. A single module can contain one or several statements closely related each other. Modules work perfectly on individual level and can be integrated with other modules. A software program can be divided into modules to ease the job of programming and debugging as well. A program can be divided into small functional modules that work together to get the output. The process of subdividing a computer program into separate sub-programs is called Modular programming. Modular programming enables programmers to divide up the work and debug pieces of the program independently. The examples of modules are procedures, subroutines, and functions.\n",

    "bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-the Python Circular Import problem occurs when you accidentally name your working file the same as the module name and those modules depend on each other. This way the python opens the same file which causes a circular loop and eventually throws an error.\n",
    "For example, when you name your file as random.py and try to import “from random import randint”, it’ll throw a circular import error (also termed as from partially initialized module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, a module named module_name has function func_name, and you want to import it but it throws a circular error.\n",

    "Question:-Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the _ _name_ _ attribute or the string '_ _main_ _'?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-The __name__ variable (two underscores before and after) is a special Python variable. It gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script. Sometimes you write a script with functions that might be useful in other scripts as well. In Python, you can import that script as a module in another script.this special variable, you can decide whether you want to run the script. Or that you want to import the functions defined in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script - Before all other code is run, the __name__ variable is set to __main__. After that, the main and myFunction def statements are run. Because the condition evaluates to true, the main function is called. This, in turn, calls myFunction. This prints out the value of __main__.\n",
    "Import the script in another script\n",
    "If we want to re-use myFunction in another script, for example importingScript.py, we can import nameScript.py as a module.\n",
    "In importingScript.py the __name__ variable is set to __main__. By importing nameScript, Python starts looking for a file by adding .py to the module name. It then runs the code contained in the imported file.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this time it is set to nameScript. Again the def statements for main and myFunction are run. But, now the condition evaluates to false and main is not called.\n",
    "\n",
    "In importingScript.py we call myFunction which outputs nameScript. NameScript is known to myFunction when that function was defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would print __name__ in the importingScript, this would output __main__. The reason for this is that Python uses the value known in the scope of importingScript."

    "\n",
    "Answer:-RPN saves time and keystrokes. You avoid using and keeping track of parentheses while doing calculations. The process is similar to the way you learned math on paper.\n",
    "we can see the intermediary results as you perform your computations rather than just the answer at the end. This is extremely helpful for learning the logic. Math teachers are using this feature to improve student understanding of mathematics.\n",

    "An intermediate result allows the user to check the answer and correct errors more easily. It's easier to follow the stream of calculation. The user defines the priority of operators.\n",

In reverse Polish notation, the former could be written 3 4 5 × −, which unambiguously means 3 (4 5 ×) − which reduces to 3 20 − (which can further be reduced to -17); the latter could be written 3 4 − 5 × (or 5 3 4 − ×, if keeping similar formatting), which unambiguously means (3 4 −) 5 ×."
