    "    programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than \n",
    "    one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. We have many different \n",
    "    types of expressions in Python. Let’s discuss all types along with some exemplar codes :\n",

    "    1. Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    The result of this type of expression is also a numeric value. The operators used in these expressions are arithmetic operators\n",
    "    like addition, subtraction, etc. Here are some arithmetic operators in Python:\n",

    "    Operators\tSyntax\tFunctioning\n",
    "    +\tx + y\tAddition\n",

    "    4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all \n",
    "        computations and type conversions.\n",
    "             \n",
    "    5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational \n",
    "        operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational \n",
    "        operatorand produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
